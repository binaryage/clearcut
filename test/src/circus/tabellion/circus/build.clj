      ; my post to #cljs-dev:
      ;   just wondering if there is some other state outside cljs.env to be addressed to get reproducible builds,
      ;   I have some tests checking cljs compiler output in different compilation modes:
      ;     https://github.com/binaryage/tabellion/tree/master/test/transcripts/expected
      ;   it works pretty well, the problem is when I decide to change order of the tests or filter some out,
      ;   I get slightly different results, the generated code is still correct, but js-beautify will format/insert
      ;   linebreaks to some other places for some reason
      ;
      ;   I just ran directory diff for two builds which happen to be different, and it looks that `gensym` and similar do not
      ;   reset when calling new `compiler/build`, this is probably causing flakiness of my tests, because build depends on
      ;   state of the system left from previous builds
      ; ---
      ;
      ;   ah, nevermind, found the problem, because `gensym` and similar are not reset for each new build, we may end up with
      ;   generated identifiers of different length, e.g. my-sym10 vs. my-sym12345, and this affects linebreaks of cljs
      ;   output, the solution for me was to remove all linebreaks to normalize the output before processing it further
      ;   that alone is not enough to get stable output, I also have to “reindex” all auto-gen and gensym’d symbols with
      ;   stable indexing, but that I had to do anyways
      ;
      ; so here I canoninze file by removing all linebreaks and let js-beautify do its job later
